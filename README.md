# Banking_Manageme_System_Using_Rest_API


A Banking Management System using Spring REST API is a backend application developed using the Spring Framework, specifically leveraging Spring Boot and Spring MVC to create RESTful APIs. These APIs enable interaction between client applications (web, mobile, or desktop) and the banking system. By utilizing Spring REST API, the system provides a scalable, secure, and efficient way to manage banking operations like account management, transaction processing, loan handling, and reporting.

Excution Process

Running the Backend Code:Use Postman to test the API endpoints. Postman allows you to send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to the backend and verify the responses.

Open Postman and create requests to interact with your REST API.

For example:

GET /api/accounts - Retrieve all accounts.

POST /api/accounts - Create a new account with required data in the request body.

GET /api/transactions - Fetch transaction details.

Running the Frontend Code:Open the homepage.html file in a browser. This file serves as the entry point for your application's user interface and interacts with the backend via API calls.

Ensure your backend server is running.

Open the homepage.html file in a browser.

Perform actions like logging in, transferring funds, or checking balances through the user interface.

Verify that the frontend interacts correctly with the backend, ensuring APIs are called and responses are handled properly.
Key Considerations:

Backend Dependencies: Ensure the database and other required services are up and configured correctly before testing.
Frontend API Configuration: Check that the API base URL in your frontend code matches your backend's running environment (e.g., http://localhost:8080 for local development).

CORS: If testing frontend with a browser, ensure that Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is enabled on your backend.

Error Handling: Validate proper error messages and handling both in Postman and on the frontend for failed operations.
